"""
Quantum Trust Partitioning Package

This package provides quantum-enhanced algorithms for trust-based network
partitioning and topological analysis. It includes implementations for:

- Quantum-enhanced trust metrics using simulated quantum random numbers
- Topological analysis of trust networks using persistent homology
- Quantum trust partitioning algorithms with improved security
- Visualization tools for quantum trust-based network analysis

The quantum algorithms provide enhanced security and randomness compared to
classical counterparts through simulated quantum effects.
