# Quantum Trust Partitioning with Topological Analysis

> A quantum-enhanced implementation of the Topological Network Partitioning algorithm for trust-based redistribution of nodes across consensus networks, incorporating advanced topological analysis and visualization.

## Overview

The **Quantum Trust Partitioner** algorithm extends the classical trust partitioning approach with quantum information theory principles and topological data analysis. While the classical algorithm efficiently repartitions consensus networks based on pairwise trust, the quantum version adds quantum-enhanced randomness, information-theoretic security models, and topological insights through persistent homology.

This implementation demonstrates how quantum concepts and computational topology can enhance distributed trust management for improved security and resilience in consensus networks.

## Key Features

- **Quantum‐enhanced trust metrics**: Incorporates quantum information theory principles for improved security
- **Trust‐driven partitioning**: Nodes evaluate trust sums to decide optimal network jumps
- **Jump & abandon phases**: Two‐step reconfiguration—migration followed by isolation
- **Topological analysis**: Uses persistent homology to capture higher-dimensional topological features
- **Betti numbers**: Quantifies topological features (connected components, cycles, voids) to guide partitioning
- **Enhanced visualizations**: High-quality animations and plots showing network evolution with topological features
- **Stability analysis**: Measures resilience of network partitioning under perturbations
- **Python 3**: Pure-Python implementation with standard scientific libraries

## Animations and Visualizations

This implementation generates several high-quality visualizations:

1. **Network Evolution Animation**: Shows how networks evolve over time during partitioning, with concurrent visualization of topological features
2. **Filtration Animation**: Demonstrates how simplicial complexes evolve as filtration value changes
3. **Stability Analysis Plots**: Shows how network configuration responds to perturbations
4. **Betti Curves**: Plots the evolution of Betti numbers as filtration value changes
5. **Persistence Diagrams**: Visualizes the birth and death of topological features

## Quantum Enhancements

The implementation incorporates several quantum-inspired principles:

1. **Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)**: Simulates true randomness for decision making
2. **Quantum-Enhanced Trust**: Models quantum advantages in trust relationships
3. **Entanglement-Inspired Networks**: Network structures that capture quantum correlation properties
4. **Non-local Trust Verification**: Decision-making inspired by quantum non-locality
5. **Quantum Entropy Addition**: Combination of classical and quantum randomness for maximum entropy
